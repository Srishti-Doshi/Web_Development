                “A dog’s love is pure, but its bravery is greater. Motu proved that true friendship means protection, loyalty, and courage. Every little girl deserves a guardian like him.”

                Tinka was a cheerful little girl who loved spending her time outdoors. Her best friend was Motu, a
                beautiful brown dog with soft fur and shining eyes. Motu followed her everywhere, whether she was
                playing in the garden, walking in the fields, or simply sitting under a tree. To Tinka, Motu was more
                than just a pet — he was family.

                One warm afternoon, Tinka was sitting near a big tree in her backyard, making tiny houses out of mud.
                She was lost in her play when, from the bushes, a snake slowly crawled out. Its hood rose high, and it
                moved closer to the little girl. Tinka froze, her heart pounding, too scared to even scream.

                Motu, who was resting nearby, immediately noticed the danger. With a loud, sharp bark, he rushed forward
                and stood between Tinka and the snake. His growls filled the air as he bared his teeth, ready to fight.
                The snake hissed angrily and tried to come closer, but Motu was fearless. He barked again and leaped
                toward it, forcing the snake to strike back.

                Bravely, Motu snapped and pushed the snake away, his courage never breaking. After a tense moment, the
                snake realized it could not win and slithered back into the bushes. The danger was gone.

                Tinka ran to Motu and hugged him tightly, her small hands holding his neck as tears of relief filled her
                eyes. “Motu, you saved me,” she whispered. Motu wagged his tail, licking her cheek, as if to say, “I’ll
                always protect you.”

                From that day, everyone in Tinka’s family said, “Motu is not just a dog, he is a hero.” And to Tinka,
                Motu was truly her guardian, her best friend, and her brave brown savior.
