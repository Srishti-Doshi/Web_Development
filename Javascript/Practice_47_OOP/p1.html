<!-- Object Oriented Programming
Object oriented programming is not used in beginner level projects but its need increses very much when moving towards complex javascript

the result we achieve using object oriented programming can be achieved via functional programmming too...

In object oriented programming we create real world objects from real world templates
Bank -> form (template) <- objects ko banani ki template
Tinka -> form ->fill-> Tinka's form (object)
Tiku -> form ->fill-> Tiku's form (object)
